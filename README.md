# Healthcare Analytics Projects Repository

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to a range of data-driven healthcare projects aimed at enhancing public health understanding and decision-making. It features in-depth analyses on various health topics, including epidemic tracking and individual health risk assessments.

## Projects Overview

### 1. COVID-19 Data Analysis
**Objective**: Analyze global COVID-19 data to track and understand the dynamics of the pandemic, focusing on infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination progress globally.

#### Tools and Technologies:
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs to illustrate trends and patterns.

### 2. Stroke Risk Prediction
**Objective**: Develop a predictive model using healthcare data to assess stroke risk based on individual health indicators and pre-existing conditions.

#### Setup and Dependencies:
Before running the project, ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
```bash
pip3 install --user pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn imbalanced-learn joblib

### Key Activities:
Data Preprocessing: Techniques include imputing missing values, encoding categorical features, and addressing data imbalances.
Model Development: Use of various machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) with and without hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV.
Feature Selection and Evaluation: Application of statistical tests and recursive feature elimination to pinpoint significant features, assessing model performance through precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.
Repository Goals
This repository serves as a hub for collaborative development and sharing of advanced analytics methodologies applied to urgent healthcare questions. Each project within this repository aims to harness statistical and machine learning techniques to provide actionable insights, improve preventive strategies, and support policy-making in healthcare.

### Conclusion
The diversity of projects within this repository reflects our commitment to leveraging data science for meaningful impacts in healthcare. We focus on robust data analysis, effective visualization, and predictive modeling to tackle some of the most pressing health issues faced today.
